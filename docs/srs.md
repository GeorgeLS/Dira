## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to build an online service to manage tracking, analysis and development
of software using the Scrum methodology.

### 1.2 Document Conventions

|Abbreviation|Meaning|
|     ---    |  ---  |
|SaaS|Software as a Service|
|SPA|Single Page Applications|

### 1.3 Project Scope

The purprose of the online issue tracking platform is to enable multiple teams to develop many
projects based on the Scrum methodology.\
The platform will support the relative domain specific features such as Epics and Stories.\
The platform will be provided as a service (SasS).

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

### 2.2 Product Features

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

### 2.4 Operating Environment

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Contstraints

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Functional Requiremenets

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces

- Front end software: HTML5, JavaScript
- Back end software: Java, SQL

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces

- Any operating system that supports JVM and Postgre SQL
- Any browser compatible with HTML5 and JavaScript ECS6

### 4.3 Software Interfaces

| Software Used | Description |
| --- | --- |
|Java|We have chosen Java that supports almost every commercial operating system due to JVM support|
|Database|To save the Epics, Stories, Bugs and Users we have chosen Postgre SQL|
|React|We have chosen React for the front end because it has the fastest rendering, good support for most browsers and SPA are more dynamic|

### 4.4 Communication Interfaces

The project supports all types of web browsers and software platforms as it uses JSON to communicate which is platform agnostic.
